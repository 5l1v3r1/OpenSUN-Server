OpenSUN Emu is an attempt to create from scratch a fully functional Soul of the Ultimate Nation game server.

## Project state
Currently, the project is at the stage of modeling architecture. I strive to recognize as many behaviors as possible without any optimization. Therefore, the code may be inefficient and full of unrecognized errors.

## Requirements
 - PostgreSQL 10
 - Java Runtime Environment 8

## Files
 - [Server Suite (31.07.2019)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18D...r9pEusguJf8rUe)
